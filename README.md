# Energy Management Strategy in Hybrid Electric Vehicle
Predicting the performance of a Hybrid EV (Electric Vehicle) is significant to alleviate the
complications of insufficient fuel and other battery-related problems that affect the driving
capacity. Many energy management techniques with ML (Machine Learning) and DL (Deep
Learning) methodologies have been deployed in predicting the operation of vehicles based on
energy sources and their features. Still, it is being noticed that prediction errors have increased
along with the increase or decrease of input data. To solve the challenges addressed in existing
studies, the proposed approach intends to use both ML and DL to predict faults from battery
features that considerably manage the energy. It is accomplished through efficient feature
extraction employed by Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory), which extracts the
best energy features required for predicting the defects. From the extracted input features
collected hourly, daily, and monthly from the dataset, classification is done using the Modified
XGBoost Algorithm with Empirical Loss function. Normal and Abnormal functioning of the
Hybrid EV is classified effectively.
